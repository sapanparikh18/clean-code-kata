# Clean Code Kata - E-commerce Order Processing

Welcome to the Clean Code Kata! This project is designed to help developers practice identifying and fixing common violations of clean code and SOLID principles in a realistic NestJS application.

## üéØ Purpose

This kata contains intentionally written "bad code" that violates various clean code and SOLID principles. Your mission is to identify these violations and refactor the code to follow best practices. The project simulates a simple e-commerce system with user management, product inventory, and order processing.

## üß™ Clean Code Principles

Before starting the kata, familiarize yourself with these key principles:

1. **Meaningful Names**
    - Variables, functions, and classes should have clear, pronounceable names
    - Avoid single-letter names or cryptic abbreviations
    - Names should reveal intent

2. **Functions**
    - Should be small and do one thing well (Single Responsibility)
    - Ideally fewer than 20 lines
    - Should have descriptive names
    - Should have 3 or fewer parameters

3. **Comments & Documentation**
    - Code should be self-documenting
    - Comments should explain WHY, not WHAT
    - Keep comments meaningful and up-to-date

4. **Code Structure & Formatting**
    - Consistent indentation and spacing
    - Related code should be grouped together
    - Follow established team conventions

5. **Error Handling**
    - Use exceptions rather than return codes
    - Don't swallow exceptions
    - Provide context with exceptions
    - Define exception classes in terms of a caller's needs

6. **Unit Tests**
    - One assert per test
    - Tests should be fast, independent, repeatable
    - Follow F.I.R.S.T principles
    - Test edge cases and error conditions

7. **SOLID Principles**
    - Single Responsibility Principle
    - Open/Closed Principle
    - Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Interface Segregation Principle
    - Dependency Inversion Principle

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## üéØ Exercise Instructions

1. **Identify Violations**: First, go through the codebase and identify as many clean code and SOLID principle violations as you can find. Keep a list of what you find.

2. **Plan Refactoring**: Before making changes, plan your refactoring approach. Consider:
    - Which violations are most critical?
    - What dependencies exist between different parts of the code?
    - How can you make incremental improvements while keeping the tests passing?

3. **Refactor**: Start refactoring the code, focusing on one principle at a time:
    - Keep the tests running
    - Make small, incremental changes
    - Commit frequently with descriptive messages
    - Add new tests as needed

4. **Key Areas to Examine**:
    - `src/entities/`: Look for poor naming and unnecessary abbreviations
    - `src/services/order.service.ts`: Check for SRP violations and error handling
    - `src/controllers/`: Examine error handling and input validation
    - `src/tests/`: Look for missing test cases and poor test organization

## üéØ Specific Challenges

Try to find and fix at least one instance of each:

1. **Poor Naming**
    - Single-letter variable names
    - Unclear abbreviations
    - Misleading names

2. **Function Issues**
    - Methods that are too long
    - Methods that do multiple things
    - Too many parameters

3. **Error Handling Problems**
    - Swallowed exceptions
    - Missing error cases
    - Poor error messages

4. **SOLID Violations**
    - Classes with multiple responsibilities
    - Tight coupling between classes
    - Concrete class dependencies instead of interfaces

5. **Testing Issues**
    - Missing test cases
    - Poor test organization
    - Incomplete coverage

## üí° Tips

- Run the tests frequently to ensure your changes haven't broken anything
- Use TypeScript's type system to your advantage
- Consider extracting interfaces for better abstraction
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Keep the Single Responsibility Principle in mind
- Add documentation as you refactor

## üèÜ Definition of Done

Your refactored code should:

1. Have clear, meaningful names for all variables, functions, and classes
2. Have small, focused functions that do one thing well
3. Handle errors appropriately with meaningful error messages
4. Follow SOLID principles
5. Have comprehensive test coverage
6. Be well-documented
7. Pass all existing tests and any new tests you've added
